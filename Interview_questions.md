5. What is the most confusing topic from week one of class?

### Week 3:
Biases in data visualization

There are numerous types/forms of biases, such as technical, language bias, biased data narrative, replication bias. Good article here: https://alshams.github.io/responsibledata/bias-in-data-viz/
Can you find an example where the chart or other data visualization is misrepresenting the actual research? 
1. How might a visualization appear different to viewers from different cultures?
2. What are apophenia and confirmation bias and how do they affect the creation of visualizations?
3. At what point could a misleading chart become unethical?

### Week 4:
1. What is the difference between descriptive statistics
  and inferential statistics?
2. How would you explain a 95% confidence interval
  to an executive with no statistics background?
3. What is a t-test?
4. What are some different types of distributions
  and what are their qualities?
5. What are null and alternative hypotheses?
  Give an example.
6. When is more data better? When is it worse?
7. How do you keep up with economic and
  business news? How about data science news?
  
### Week 7:
1.  What is linear regression?
- Linear Regression is a statistical model that seeks to describe the relationship between some y variable and one or more x variables.

### Synonyms for "y variable"
- Dependent Variable
- Response Variable
- Outcome Variable 
- Predicted Variable
- Measured Variable
- Explained Variable
- Label

### Synonyms for "x variable(s)"
- Indepent Variable
- Explanatory Variable
- Regressor
- Covariate

### The Equation for a Line
A common equation for a line is:

\begin{align}
y = mx + b
\end{align}

Where $m$ is the slope of the line and $b$ is the y-intercept. 
Linear Regression seeks to **estimate** the slope and intercept values that describe a line that best fits the data points.

2. What is residual error?
- The residual error is the distance between points in our dataset and our regression line.

3. What is the most common way to minimize residual error?
- The most common method of estimating our $\beta$ parameters (slope and intercept) is what's known as "Ordinary Least Squares" (OLS). (There are different methods of arriving at a line of best fit). OLS estimates the parameters that minimize the squared distance between each point in our dataset and our line of best fit. 

\begin{align}
SSE = \sum(y_i - \hat{y})^2
\end{align}

### week 11:
1. How are you today?
2. How is object-oriented programming different from functional programming? What are some advantages or disadvantages of each?
3. What is the relationship between modules, packages, dependencies, and namespaces in Python?
4.  What are some differences between Bayesian statistics and frequentist statistics? When might you use one over the other?
5.  How does a confusion matrix help you understand your model better?
6.  What is the alignment problem in artificial intelligence?
7.  We offer great flexibility in our employees’ scheduling? What would your ideal work week look like?

### Week 12:
1. So far in this sprint you've used SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. For each of these, consider the following questions:

- What was easy about using this technology?
- What was hard about using this technology?
- What more would you like to learn about it?

Write a summary in the style of a possible blog post, and bring the
questions/discussion to class. Bonus - later on, follow up and complete a real
blog post about different database technologies!

### week 13:

1. What about our company excites you the most? (_assume it is a company in a field you are *NOT* excited about_)
2. What is pipelining and how might you build one in Python?
3. What is the inverse of the squish function?
4. You are on a boat and throw a suitcase overboard. Does the water level increase?
5. What would you do if a teammate changed your work without consulting you first?
6. Whats your current biggest DS-related weakness and what are your plans on it?
7. You don’t have a Phd. or a degree in a requisite field.  Why should we hire you?

### Week 14:

1. What was your biggest achievement in your last job?
2. Do you prefer working in a team or alone? Why?
3. What are two or three specific applications of data science that get you most excited?
4. What are some key differences between Python and Scala?
5. What is a method for determining if statistics published in an article are either wrong or presented to support the author’s point of view?
6. Explain what resampling methods are and why they are useful. What are their limitations?
7. In late 2016, a new recruit at Facebook designed a new feature to improve click-through rates on ads for political ads. They deployed their feature on a representative sample of users from across the country. The feature did not improve rates significantly in the general population, but it DID improve click-throughs for two groups: Female Texan college graduates between the ages of 30 and 35 and Male Floridian high-school graduates between 18 and 25.  The recruit’s manager was reviewing this data and had to decide whether to invest more time into testing/deploying it further.  What is the first question the manager should ask?
8. What would make you quit a job you just started?

### Week 16:

5. Give an example of a time you would use a decision tree?
6. How many golf balls would fit into a Boeing 747?
7. What was the most difficult task you’ve faced in your last job and how did you overcome it?
8. If your manager asked you to do some task with data that you believed was unethical, how would you respond?

### Week 17:
